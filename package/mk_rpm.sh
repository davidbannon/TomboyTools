#!/usr/bin/bash

# ====================================================
# a short script to make RPMs from our  debs
# does more than just call alien as that seems to end up
# with commands to create / and /usr/bin that upset yum
#
# This script must be run as fake root, so useage is -
# fakeroot bash mk_rpm
#
# History
# 2020/03/10 
# Finally worked out why yum won't work, while the rpm
# command is happy with me calling the arch i386, amd64 (debian speak)
# yum insists on them being x86, x86_64.
# Manually add wmctrl to dependencies.
# 2021/05/15
# don't add gnome-shell-extension-appindicator to dependencies,
# it pulls in half of Gnome desktop, on gnome users would hate me.
