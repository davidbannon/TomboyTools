TomboyTools



This is a small FPC/Lazarus project that provides some tools to help manage a Tomboy/tomboy-ng note collection. Things like importing and exporting, perhaps in in bulk. Exporting as plain text, Markdown and HTML.



You can export and export notes, one by one, all in a particular Notebook or all in a directory.  This tool should work fine with Tomboy, tomboy-ng or, perhaps, G-Note.



While primarily made for my own use or, from time to time to help a tomboy-ng user, I can make a packaged version if you need one. Best to ask on the tomboy-ng issues page. https://github.com/tomboy-notes/tomboy-ng/issues
