TomboyTools
===========



This is a small FPC/Lazarus project that provides some tools to help manage a Tomboy/tomboy-ng note collection. Things like importing and exporting in bulk and repairing broken sync directories.



Its not high on my priority list so it only gets worked on when someone asks for help. At some stage I will tidy it up and do a formal release but probably not soon.



So, if you need something, best to ask on the tomboy-ng issues page.
